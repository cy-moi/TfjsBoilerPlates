# TfjsBoilerPlates (Under Restructure)

I need to change all of these. Currently it is a mess. Also I used mediapipe and tensorflowjs-models which are redundant. Decided to stick with the latter one because it would be easier to make changes. COMPLETE THIS IN NOVEMBER I HOPE?

# Entries
`entries=entry_name` set environment entries variable to select entry point. Url falls back to `/entry_name`.

Current demo: `entries=hand yarn start`

# TODO
- [ ] clean up codes and make easy-to-use templates with ts
- [ ] example with full body detection
- [ ] example with 3D graphics library, such as three.js
- [ ] add another face doodle example in which hand detections used for drawing
